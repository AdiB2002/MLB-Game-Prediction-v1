# MLB-Game-Prediction-v1
To predict upcoming MLB games, I downloaded team statistics, scraped game data, and then used machine learning (utilizing an ensemble of models). Currently predicting at up to 71% accuracy which is 12% above my baseline model. Baseline model uses which team has the better record to predict winners (59% accurate).
